# Guess

A random number guessing game using the do...while loop

## Usage

1. Include guess.js in an HTML doc containing an element with an id of 'root'.

    ```html
    <div id="root">@</div>
    <script src="root.js"></script>
    ```

2. The system will run automatically until it reaches the designated number and will output how many tries it took to get to it.

````html
`
<h2>I guessed it!</h2>
<p>It only took me ${guessNumber} guesses!</p>
`; ```
````
